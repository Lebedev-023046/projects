                            Currently we have 121 dogs and 342 cats on our hands and
                            statistics show that only 20% of them will find a family.
                            The others will continue to live with us and will be waiting
                            for a lucky chance to become dearly loved.
                        </p>
                        <p class="subheading">
                            We feed our wards with the best food and make sure that they
                            do not get sick, feel comfortable (including psychologically) 
                            and well. We are supported by 87 volunteers and 28 employees of 
                            various skill levels. About 12% of the animals are taken by the shelter 
                            staff. Taking care of the animals, they become attached to the pets and 
                            would hardly ever leave them alone.
